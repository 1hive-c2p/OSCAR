summary: Runtime leakage of password 

description: |
  This attack technique involves searching for passwords or other sensitive information that is passed as parameters or environment variables during the runtime of a code or containerized application.
  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by intercepting the runtime process and capturing the sensitive information in transit. 
  Once the password or sensitive information is captured, the attacker can use it to gain unauthorized access to the system or associated resources.
