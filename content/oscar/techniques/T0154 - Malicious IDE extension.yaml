summary: Malicious IDE extension

description: |
  Malicious IDE extension attack is an attack technique in which an attacker creates a malicious extension for an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and uploads it to the IDE's extension marketplace or repository. 
  The malicious extension may appear to be a legitimate tool or add-on, but when installed, it can perform unauthorized actions such as stealing user credentials or introducing vulnerabilities in the code.
  Once installed, a malicious IDE extension can access the developer's code, which can contain sensitive information such as access keys, passwords, and credentials. 
  This information can then be used by the attacker to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources, steal data, or launch further attacks.
