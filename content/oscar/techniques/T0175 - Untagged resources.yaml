summary: Untagged resources

description: |
  In this technique, the attacker first gains access to the cloud environment, either through a vulnerability or by compromising user credentials. 
  Once they have access, they search for resources that are not properly tagged or have incomplete tagging, which can make them harder to track and identify.
  The attacker then creates an untagged resource, such as an instance or a volume, and uses it to store and maintain persistent access to the compromised environment. 
  Since the resource is not properly tagged, it is harder for the cloud provider or the victim to detect and identify it as a potential threat.
  This technique can be used to maintain access to the cloud environment even after the original point of entry has been remediated or patched.
