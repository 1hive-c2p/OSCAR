summary: Exposed storage

description: |
  Exposed storage is an attack technique where an attacker targets and exploits cloud storage containers or buckets that are publicly accessible or have weak access controls. 
  The attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored in the containers, such as personal information, financial data, or intellectual property.
  Exposed storage can occur due to misconfigured access controls, where the data is mistakenly made publicly available or accessible to unauthorized users. 
  This can occur when the default security settings for cloud storage services are not properly adjusted, or when access controls are not regularly reviewed and updated.
