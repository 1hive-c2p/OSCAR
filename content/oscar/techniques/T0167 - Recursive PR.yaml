summary: Recursive PR

description: |
  The Recursive PR attack technique is a persistence tactic that involves an attacker submitting a pull request to a repository that contains a malicious code change. 
  Once the pull request is merged and the code change is deployed, the malicious code is executed and establishes a persistent presence in the CI/CD pipeline.
  The attack works by creating a chain of pull requests where each subsequent pull request is used to modify the code introduced in the previous pull request.
  This creates a recursive loop where the pipeline will continuously build and deploy new versions of the code that contain the attacker's modifications. 
  By doing so, the attacker can maintain a persistent presence in the CI/CD pipeline and potentially use it to execute further attacks.
