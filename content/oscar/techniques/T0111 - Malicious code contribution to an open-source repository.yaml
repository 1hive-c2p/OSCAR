summary: Malicious code contribution to an open-source repository

description: |
  A malicious code contribution to an open-source repository attack is a type of cyber attack that involves an attacker submitting code with malicious intent to an open-source repository. 
  Open-source repositories are used to store and manage code for open-source software projects, and they rely on community contributions to improve and maintain the codebase. 
  In this attack, the attacker may submit a seemingly harmless code contribution to the repository. However, the code contains a hidden malware payload that can be triggered later to cause damage. 
  Alternatively, the code may include a backdoor that allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system running the open-source software.
  Once the code is accepted into the repository, it can be difficult to detect the presence of the malicious payload.
  The code may be integrated into the open-source project, distributed to other projects that depend on it, and even included in software distributions used by many people. 
  This can result in a wide-scale compromise of systems that use the affected code.
