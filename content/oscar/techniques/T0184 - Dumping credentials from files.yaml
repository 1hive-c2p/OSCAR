summary: Harvesting sensitive information from files

description: |
  This attack involves searching for files within the CI/CD system that may contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, or other access tokens.
  These files can include configuration files, scripts, and other files that are used as part of the build and deployment process. 
  Attackers can use various techniques to locate these files, including directory traversal attacks, file inclusion vulnerabilities, or simply guessing common file names or paths.
  Once the attacker has located a file containing sensitive information, they can extract the credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the targeted system or application.
