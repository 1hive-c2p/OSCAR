summary: Harvest secrets from logs

description: |
  This attack involves searching through logs generated by a system to find sensitive information that may have been inadvertently logged. 
  Such information can include passwords, API keys, access tokens, or other types of credentials.
  In many systems, logs are generated automatically as part of normal operations.
  Attackers can exploit this by searching through the logs to find any sensitive information that has been logged. 
  Once this information is found, the attacker can use it to gain unauthorized access to the system or associated resources.
