summary: Compromised user account

description: |
  A compromised user account is a serious security threat, as attackers can use it to bypass security measures that are in place to protect an organization's assets. 
  Attackers can gain access to legitimate user accounts in several ways, including brute-force attacks, phishing, malware, or social engineering.
  Once an attacker gains access to a user's account, they can access the cloud resources, artifact repository, infrastructure-as-code templates, or source code repository to steal or modify sensitive data or launch further attacks.
  In such case an attacker is able to modify the code and cloud resources, inject malware or backdoors, or replace legitimate artifacts.
  This can result in data breaches, system downtime, reputation damage, and financial losses.
