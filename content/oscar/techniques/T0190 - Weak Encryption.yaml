summary: Weak encryption

description: |
  A weak encryption attack in cloud security occurs when an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the encryption mechanism used by a cloud service to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. 
  This can happen when the encryption algorithm used by the cloud service is weak or when the encryption keys are not properly managed.
