summary: Vulnerability in third-party dependency

description: | 
  This technique takes advantage of the fact that most software applications rely on third-party libraries or components for various functions, such as authentication, encryption, or data processing.
  Attackers can identify and exploit vulnerabilities in these third-party dependencies to gain access to the target system or network. 
  They may do this by finding and exploiting known vulnerabilities or by creating custom exploits to target specific vulnerabilities.
  Once the attackers gains access, they can move laterally throughout the system or network to access sensitive data, install malware or carry out other malicious activities.
  This attack technique can be particularly effective because developers often do not have full control over the security of third-party dependencies.
