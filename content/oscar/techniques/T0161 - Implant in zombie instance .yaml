summary: Implant in zombie instance 

description: |
  Implant in zombie instance is a persistence tactic used in cloud security to maintain unauthorized access to a compromised instance. 
  This technique involves planting malicious code or a backdoor into a compromised instance and using it as a "zombie" or "bot" to perform further malicious actions.
  Once an instance is compromised, the attacker can implant a backdoor to ensure future access even if the original vulnerability is fixed or the stolen credentials are changed.
  The implanted code can be designed to run persistently in the background, making it difficult to detect. 
  Attackers can use the zombie instance to perform various malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive data, launching DDoS attacks, or using the instance for cryptocurrency mining.
