summary: Compromised service account

description: |
  In this type of attack, the attacker gains access to a legitimate service account, which is typically used by an application or service to access cloud resources or manage infrastructure. 
  The attacker can use the compromised service account to perform actions that are authorized for the service account, such as reading, modifying, or deleting data.
  This can result in data theft, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, and the ability to launch further attacks on other resources within the cloud environment.
