summary: Accidental public disclosure of internal resources

description: |
  This technique involves searching for internal resources that have been inadvertently made public and are accessible to anyone on the internet.
  An attacker can use this technique to identify internal resources that may contain sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or other credentials. 
  They can also use this technique to identify other internal resources that may be of interest, such as databases or servers.
  There are several ways that internal resources can be accidentally made public, including misconfigured security settings, unintentional exposure of credentials, or through the use of unsecured storage buckets. 
  When resources are accidentally made public, it can be easy for an attacker to locate and access them.
