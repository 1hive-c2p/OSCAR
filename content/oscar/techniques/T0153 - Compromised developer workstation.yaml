summary: Compromised developer workstation

description: |
  Compromised developer workstation attack is a technique where an attacker gains access to a developer's machine, which contains sensitive information such as access credentials, keys, and code repositories. 
  This technique can allow an attacker to steal code or modify it to include backdoors or other malicious code. 
  The attacker can also use this access to gain entry into other systems within the organization.
  This type of attack can be carried out through various means, such as Phishing, Typosquatting, Brandjacking, malicious IDE extensions, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the developer's system. 
  Once the attacker gains access, they can install malware or backdoors, extract sensitive information, or use the machine as a foothold to carry out further attacks.
