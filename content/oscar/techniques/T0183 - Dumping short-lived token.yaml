summary: Dumping short-lived token

description: |
  This attack technique involves searching for short-lived tokens that are used during the CI/CD process and extracting them for later use in unauthorized activities.
  Short-lived tokens are often used in CI/CD systems to authenticate communication between different components, such as the build server and the deployment server.
  An attacker can obtain these tokens from CI/CD logs, variable groups, secure files, etc.
  These tokens typically have a limited lifespan, but if an attacker is able to capture them, they can use them to gain unauthorized access to the system or associated resources.
