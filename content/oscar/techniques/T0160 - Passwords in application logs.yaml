summary: Passwords in application logs

description: |
  This type of attack involves searching through application logs generated by cloud and container applications for any passwords that may have been inadvertently logged.
  In cloud and container environments, application logs are often generated automatically and may contain a wealth of information about the system's configuration, the commands that were executed, and any errors or warnings that were encountered. 
  In some cases, these logs may also contain passwords or other sensitive information that was inadvertently logged.
  Attackers can exploit this by searching through the logs for any passwords that may have been logged, and then using these passwords to gain access to the associated resources.
