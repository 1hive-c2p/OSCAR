summary: Exposed database

description: |
  Exposing a database to the public internet can be a critical security issue, as attackers can use it to gain access to sensitive information.
  In the context of cloud security and infrastructure as code, this attack technique typically involves misconfigured security group rules or network access control lists (ACLs) that allow public access to a database. 
  It can also occur when developers or system administrators accidentally expose database credentials or when misconfigured server configurations allow database access.
