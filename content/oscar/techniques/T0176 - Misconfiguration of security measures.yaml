summary: Misconfiguration of security measures

description: |
  Misconfiguration of security measures refers to an attack technique where an attacker takes advantage of misconfigured security settings in cloud environments to evade detection and launch further attacks. 
  This technique is commonly used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources, exfiltrate data, or launch other types of attacks.
  In cloud environments, misconfigured security measures can occur due to various reasons such as incomplete security configurations, outdated software, or a lack of security controls. 
  Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to gain access to sensitive information, resources, or systems. 
  For example, an attacker can take advantage of misconfigured security groups or firewall rules to bypass security controls and access sensitive data or resources.
