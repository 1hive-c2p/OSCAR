summary: Services(Servers) compromise

description: |
  Services (servers) compromise attack in the supply chain is a type of attack that targets the servers hosting the software development and distribution infrastructure. 
  This attack can happen when an attacker gains access to the server through a vulnerability, misconfiguration, or social engineering attack. 
  Once the attacker gains access to the server, they can modify the source code or software packages being distributed to include malicious code or backdoors. 
  This attack can compromise multiple software projects and potentially all users who download or use the compromised software.
