summary: Repojacking

description: |
  Dependency repository hijacking (aka repo jacking) is an obscure supply chain vulnerability, conceptually similar to subdomain takeover, that impacts over 70,000 open-source projects and affects everything from web frameworks to cryptocurrencies. 
  This vulnerability is trivial to exploit, results in remote code injection, and affects major projects from companies like Google, GitHub, Facebook, Kubernetes, NodeJS, Amazon, and many others. 
  Every project whose compilation depends on dynamically linked code from GitHub repositories is potentially vulnerable. 
  When the linked repository owner changes their username, it becomes immediately available to be re-registered by anyone. 
  This means that any project that linked back to the original repository URL has now become vulnerable to remote code injection through dependency hijacking. 
  A malicious attacker can register the old GitHub username, recreate the repository, and use it to serve malicious code to any project that depends on it.
