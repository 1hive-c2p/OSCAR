summary: Malicious Compiler or Interpreter

description: |
  The malicious compiler or interpreter attack is a defense evasion technique where an attacker modifies the software development tools to insert malicious code into the final product. 
  This allows attackers to bypass security controls and gain access to systems or data. 
  The attack involves replacing a legitimate compiler or interpreter with a malicious version that can execute malicious instructions or hide the attacker's activities. 
  This technique is often used to insert backdoors into software and bypass security controls designed to prevent the execution of malicious code.
