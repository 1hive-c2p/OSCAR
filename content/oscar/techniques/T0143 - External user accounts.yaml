summary: External user accounts

description: |
  External User Accounts attack technique in the CI/CD, SCM posture and cloud security involves compromising external user accounts to gain unauthorized access to CI/CD pipelines, source code repositories or cloud systems.
  Attackers may gain unauthorized access to these accounts through various means, such as phishing, social engineering, or password cracking. 
  Once compromised, attackers can inject malicious code into CI/CD pipelines, tamper with deployment pipelines, manipulate source code repositories, or access cloud systems. 
  This can result in the deployment of unauthorized or malicious code to production systems, introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into source code, theft of intellectual property, or other malicious activities.
