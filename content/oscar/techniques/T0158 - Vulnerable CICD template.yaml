summary: Vulnerable CICD template

description: |
  Vulnerable CI/CD template attack is an attack technique that targets the templates used in the CI/CD pipeline configuration. 
  These templates are used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. 
  Attackers can modify these templates to include malicious code or configuration that can result in unauthorized access or data theft.
  In this attack, the attacker typically searches for templates that have known vulnerabilities or weak configurations. 
  Once identified, the attacker can modify the template to include their malicious code or configuration. 
  The attacker then waits for the target to use the modified template in their CI/CD pipeline, which can result in the attacker gaining access to sensitive data or systems.
