summary: Passwords in CICD logs

description: |
  This type of attack involves searching through the logs generated by the CI/CD system for any sensitive information that may have been inadvertently logged, such as passwords, API keys, or other types of credentials.
  In a CI/CD system, logs are generated automatically as part of the build and deployment process. 
  These logs may contain information about the system's configuration, the commands that were executed, and any errors or warnings that were encountered. 
  In some cases, these logs may also contain sensitive information that was inadvertently included in the command-line arguments, environment variables, or other parts of the system configuration.
