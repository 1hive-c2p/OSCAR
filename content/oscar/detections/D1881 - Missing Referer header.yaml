summary: Missing Referer header
description: |
  Check the Referer header in incoming HTTP requests to ensure that they match the expected source of the request. 
  If the Referer header is missing or does not match the expected source, it could indicate a potential CSRF attack. However, note that the Referer header can be easily spoofed or omitted by some browsers, so this technique may not be foolproof.
