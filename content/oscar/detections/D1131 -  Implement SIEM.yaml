summary: Implement SIEM
description: |
  Implement a SIEM system to centralize and analyze logs and events from various sources, including user account-related activities. Use SIEM rules or correlation rules to detect any abnormal or suspicious user account-related activities, such as multiple failed login attempts, changes to account settings outside of normal patterns, or simultaneous login attempts from different locations.
