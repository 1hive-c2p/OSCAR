summary: Avoid using self-hosted runners for public repositories
description: |
  We recommend that you only use self-hosted runners with private repositories. 
  This is because forks of your public repository can potentially run dangerous code on your self-hosted runner machine by creating a pull request that executes the code in a workflow.
  This is not an issue with GitHub-hosted runners because each GitHub-hosted runner is always a clean isolated virtual machine, and it is destroyed at the end of the job execution.
