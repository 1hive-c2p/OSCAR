summary: Implement proper access control for databases
description: |
  Review and restrict security group rules, network ACLs, and firewall rules associated with the database to allow access only from authorized IP addresses or CIDR blocks. 
  Avoid allowing unnecessary public access and follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the minimum permissions required for legitimate users and applications.
