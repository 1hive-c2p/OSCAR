summary: Protect database credentials
description: |
  Avoid hardcoding database credentials in code or configuration files. 
  Use secure methods for managing and storing credentials, such as encrypted secrets management tools or credential vaults. 
  Limit the access and exposure of database credentials to only authorized personnel, and promptly revoke access for users who no longer require it
