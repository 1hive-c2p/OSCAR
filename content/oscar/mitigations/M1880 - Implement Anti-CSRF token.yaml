summary: Implement Anti-CSRF token
description: |
  Implementing anti-CSRF tokens, also known as CSRF tokens or synchronization tokens, can be an effective mitigation technique. 
  A unique token is generated for each user session and included in each form or request. 
  The server verifies the presence and validity of the token in each incoming request, ensuring that it originated from the same user session and not from a malicious source.
