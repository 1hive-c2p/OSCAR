summary: Implement least privilege access
description: |
  When granting permissions, you decide who is getting what permissions to which Amazon S3 resources or other cloud storages. 
  You enable specific actions that you want to allow on those resources. 
  Therefore you should grant only the permissions that are required to perform a task. 
  Implementing least privilege access is fundamental in reducing security risk and the impact that could result from errors or malicious intent.
