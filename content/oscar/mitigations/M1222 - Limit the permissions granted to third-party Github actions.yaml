summary: Limit the permissions granted to third-party Github actions
description: |
  Limiting the permissions granted to third-party Github actions to only the necessary access required for the task is a security practice that can reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline. 
  This involves evaluating the required permissions of each action and granting access on a least privilege basis, meaning that only the minimum level of access required for the intended task is granted. 
  By limiting permissions, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data, thereby improving the overall security of the CI/CD pipeline.
