summary: Implement strong authorization mechanisms
description: |
  Strong authorization ensures that users only have access to the resources and actions that are necessary for their job functions and responsibilities, and nothing more. 
  This can be achieved through proper access controls, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC), which define fine-grained permissions and privileges for users, groups, and repositories in the SCM system.
  Regularly review user permissions and remove all unnecessary permissions for specific users.
