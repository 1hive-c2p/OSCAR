summary: Use strong encryption algorithms
description: |
  Implementing strong encryption algorithms with appropriate key lengths and security parameters can significantly increase the resilience of encryption at rest mechanisms. 
  Organizations should use industry-standard encryption algorithms that are widely recognized and reviewed by the security community.
  For example, AES, ECC, RSA.
