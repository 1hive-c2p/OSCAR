summary: Use only trusted third-party Github actions from reputable sources
description: |
  Using only trusted third-party Github actions from reputable sources is an important security practice that reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline. 
  Reputable sources include established Github action providers with a history of creating high-quality, secure actions. Organizations can verify the reputation of a third-party Github action by researching the provider, reviewing their Github action repositories, and checking for reported security issues.
