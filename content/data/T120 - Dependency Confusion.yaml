summary: Dependency Confusion
description: |
    Dependency confusion is a type of supply chain attack that occurs when an attacker exploits the way some package managers, such as npm and PyPI, resolve dependencies when installing software libraries.
    In a typical software development project, developers rely on a variety of external libraries, often referred to as dependencies, to build their applications. These libraries are typically stored in a remote repository, and developers use a package manager to install and manage them.

mitigations:
# reference to mitigation references
    - Validate package/library integrity. If possible, specify a hash of the package
    - Harden package mainfest. Never leave a package with no specific version. Make sure to use only trusted repositories
