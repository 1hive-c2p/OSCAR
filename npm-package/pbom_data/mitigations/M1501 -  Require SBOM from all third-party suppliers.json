    "description": "An SBOM for every third-party artifact helps to ensure an artifact is safe to use and fully compliant. \nThis file lists all important metadata, especially all the dependencies of an artifact, and allows for verification of each dependency. \nIf one of the dependencies/artifacts is attacked or has a new vulnerability (e.g., the \u201cSolarWinds\u201d or even \u201clog4j\u201d attack), it is easier to detect what has been affected by this incident because dependencies in use are listed in the SBOM file\n",
